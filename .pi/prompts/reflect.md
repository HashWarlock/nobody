/skill:harada-coach

Time for my evening reflection. Help me write today's journal entry.

1. First, show me today's habit status
2. Walk me through the reflection prompts:
   - What went well today?
   - What didn't go as planned?
   - What did I learn?
   - What should I focus on tomorrow?
3. Ask me for my mood and energy ratings (1-5)
4. Save the journal entry

Use the harada tools to track everything. $@

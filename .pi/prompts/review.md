---
/skill:harada-coach

It's weekly review time! Let's assess my progress.

1. Show my full progress dashboard data (use harada_progress)
2. Review this week's habit completion — which habits did I hit? Which did I miss?
3. Check if any OW64 actions are ready to be marked complete
4. Analyze mood and energy trends from my journal
5. Identify patterns — what's working, what isn't
6. Suggest adjustments for next week
7. Remind me of my north star and how far I've come

Use all the harada tools to pull comprehensive data. $@

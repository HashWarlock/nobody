Good morning! Let's do my daily Harada check-in.

1. Show me my affirmation
2. How did yesterday go with my habits?
3. What are my top priorities today that move me toward my north star?
4. Which habits am I committing to today?

Use the harada tools to check my current state and guide me through this. $@
